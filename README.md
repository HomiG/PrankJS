# PrankJS

## ðŸš§ **WARNING: Super Early Development Stage** ðŸš§

PrankJS is a fun and experimental JavaScript library designed to bring a little chaos to your web applications by introducing a variety of pranks and interactive scenarios. However, please note:

### **THIS PROJECT IS IN A VERY EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.**

### ðŸš¨ **NOT EVEN ALPHA VERSION** ðŸš¨

This project is currently in a phase that's even more unstable than an alpha version. This means:

- **Heavy Refactors Are Imminent:** The structure, API, and even the purpose of the library might change dramatically as development progresses.
- **Incomplete Features:** Most features are either not fully implemented or may have significant bugs.
- **Breaking Changes:** Expect breaking changes with little or no warning as the project evolves.
- **No Guarantees:** The library may not work as expected, or at all, in its current form.

### Whatâ€™s in the Works?

- **Core Pranks:** Basic implementations of various pranks like floating objects, random redirects, and screen flipping.
- **Interactive Scenarios:** Early prototypes of scenarios that combine multiple pranks for a more immersive experience.
- **Cleanup Functions:** Mechanisms to undo the pranks, though these are still being fleshed out.

### Whatâ€™s Missing?

- **Documentation:** The current documentation is sparse and subject to change. Proper usage guides and examples will be added as the library matures.
- **Tests:** Testing is minimal at this stage, so stability cannot be guaranteed.
- **Performance Optimizations:** The library has not been optimized for performance, and using it may have a significant impact on your applicationâ€™s performance.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions, but please be aware that the codebase is likely to change significantly. If youâ€™re interested in contributing, please reach out to discuss the roadmap and where you can best help.
